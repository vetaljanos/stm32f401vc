# UART/ADC/Timers

## In this project implemented:

* ADC Continuous Conversion Mode
* ADC Scan Conversion Mode for 3 channels
* ADC DMA Continuous Requests
* 2 Timers - one for GREEN LED Indicator, second for receive ADC values and send it using UART
	
### LEDS

* Green LED (PIN_12) blinks with 1 sec frequency to indicate OS is working
* Red LED (PIN_13) blinks with different delays to indicate error
